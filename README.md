Developed a console-based simulation of a social network inspired by Google Drive and Pokec, using C++ and core Data Structures & Algorithms, in collaboration with Umm Habiba.
The system features:

User management (using arrays and file handling)

Friendship graphs (using adjacency matrix)

Set theory operations, quantifiers, tree traversal, and function properties (injective/surjective)

Advanced DSA concepts including search, permutations, combinations, inductive proofs, and relation checks (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)

Implemented binary tree traversal (preorder, postorder, BFS) to represent friend structures
